# GRIP-TASKS
Data Science and Business Analytics tasks as a part of internship at The Sparks Foundation
TASK 2- Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm :
In this file, 'IRIS' dataset is analysed and applied Machine Learning Algorithm i.e, k-Means.
k-means is  one of  the unsupervised  learning  algorithms  that  solve  the well  known clustering problem. In this problem, we are trying to get optimum number of clusters by 'WCSS' plot and 'Elbow Curve'
