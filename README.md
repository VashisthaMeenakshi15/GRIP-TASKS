TASK 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail


In this code, I have used "Samplestore" dataset in csv format to do exploratory data analysis.
EDA is a very important step in data analysis. EDA gives us a chance to gain insights from data.
In EDA we try to analyze data to find out the below stuff:
(i) Imputing missing values
(ii) Numerical Variable
(iii) Distribution of Numerical Variables
(iv) Categorical variables
(v) Outliers
(vi) Removing variance
(vii) Relationship between independent and dependent features
